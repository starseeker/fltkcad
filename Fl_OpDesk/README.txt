Fl_OpDesk -- FLTK Node Graph Widget for "Operation Boxes"
---------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS "Fl_OpDesk"?

    Fl_OpDesk is a 'node graph' or 'node tree' widget for FLTK 1.x.

LICENSING

    Fl_OpDesk comes with complete free source code. 
    Fl_OpDesk is available under the terms of the GNU Library 
    General Public License that the FLTK library uses
    (ie. the LGPL with static exceptions). See COPYING.txt
    for more info.

    Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in commercial
    software, and statically linked!

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

    Tested under Linux, Mac OSX and Windows with fltk 1.3.x.

    To build the test programs and related Fl_OpDesk object files:

	make clean     -- clean old files
	make           -- build lib and test programs

   When built successfully, these test programs are created:

	test-OpDesk       -- Simple test program

       	test-app/test-app -- A "real world" example application
	                     that lets you connect different boxes
			     that generates simple perl scripts.
			     Shows how to derive custom widgets
			     that lets you define data types and
			     language specific constructs.

	The test-app directory is supposed to be an example
	of your own application, where all those files would
	be under your control, and they derive from the Fl_OpDesk
	widget API (namely OpConnect, OpButton, OpBox, and Fl_OpDesk).

MAKEFILE NOTES

   The ./Makefile is for unix builds (linux + osx)

   The ./Makefile.MICROSOFT is used for Windows builds
   with the Microsoft VS 8.x compiler.

   Under Windows, there's a 'make.bat' that you can run by
   just typing 'make'. The 'make.bat' runs NMAKE with the
   proper flags to involve the Makefile.MICROSOFT file automatically.

   Check the Makefile's to see if you need to change any of the
   paths/compiler flags to work on your system. For instance, 
   you may need to change FLTKDIR if it resides somewhere else
   on your system.

   So on all platforms including windows, just running 'make'
   should work.

WHERE'S THE DOCUMENTATION?

    See documentation/html/index.html

    The docs are in ./documentation/html and are Doxyen based
    (comments in code), and can be re-generated by running 
    'make docs' or by simply running 'doxygen' while in ./documentation.
    The software comes distributed with pre-built docs.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Thanks to Al Ibrahim for paying the bounty for me to finish writing
    this widget as an LGPL application.  Without his financial stimulous
    and interest, I probably never would have gotten around to finishing
    this widget.

    Thanks to Reid Baker and the Cinema Graphics' "ShadeTree" software,
    which was co-designed by Reid Baker, Greg Ercolano, Rodney
    Iwashina and Liza Keith in 1995.  Cinema Graphics closed its doors
    in 2004. Thanks to Reid Baker for giving his blessings for me to
    release this widget under the LGPL.
    
    This Fl_OpDesk widget is complete rewrite from the ground-up.
    It uses no code from the original ShadeTree software (which was
    implemented in Motif and OpenGL). However, the "look" was
    purposefully preserved. You can redefine this "look" if you
    like to include more modern effects by overloading the draw()
    method of these widgets.
