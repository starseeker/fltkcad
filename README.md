FLTK experiments for CAD interfaces

A little bit of experimental code laying out a CAD interface with FLTK.  Thought I had lost it when
I went looking for it a couple years after first creating it, so this time put it on github so I can
find it when I want it again someday.

Other archives are bits that would probably be useful for creating a proper gui.  Note that dillo
is GPL, so it can be included only as a convenience bundle as a guaranteed html viewer and not
incorporated into the application (nor can code be "borrowed" from it.)  Unfortunately, short of
porting tkhtml3 to fltk, this seems to be the only practical "in-house" solution for HTML display
with fltk, not to mention it can search within a page.
